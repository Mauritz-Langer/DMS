abstract = {The S\&P 500 is a bellwether and leading indicator for the economy as well as the default vehicle for passive investors who want exposure to the U.S. economy via index funds. Since 1957, the S\&P 500 has performed amazingly, outpacing other leading asset classes such as bonds or commodities. This study seeks to develop an appropriate ARIMA model that best fit the monthly stock price of S\&P 500 for a period of 17 years, 2001–2017, thus make a short-term forecast in a way to give an overview and help the investor or portfolio manager in decision making. EViews software was used to run the analysis of the data. Our analysis involved 2-step procedure, which were identifying ARIMA model then fitting GARCH (1,1) into the model. As a result, ARIMA (2,1,2)-GARCH (1,1) model was found to be the best model for forecasting the S\&P500 stock prices. The research findings indicate that a dynamic forecast gave a better result compared to a static forecast.},

Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models and the related generalized ARCH models are popular models for volatility. This paper will introduce the need for volatility modeling as well as introduce the framework of ARCH and GARCH models. A brief discussion about the structure of ARCH and GARCH models will then be compared to other volatility modeling techniques.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT

We find support for a negative relation between conditional expected monthly return and conditional variance of monthly return, using a GARCH‐M model modified by allowing
 (1)
 seasonal patterns in volatility,
              (2)
 positive and negative innovations to returns having different impacts on conditional volatility, and
 (3)
 nominal interest rates to predict conditional variance. Using the modified GARCH‐M model, we also show that monthly conditional volatility may not be as persistent as was thought. Positive unanticipated returns appear to result in a downward revision of the conditional volatility whereas negative unanticipated returns result in an upward revision of conditional volatility.},
